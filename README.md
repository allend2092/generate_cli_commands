# generate_cli_commands

This script is a tool to help users capture packets on a VMware ESXi server. It prompts the user to enter the hostname or IP address of the ESXi server and checks if the server is reachable and listening on port 22. It then asks the user to enter the password for the ESXi server and connects to it using the Netmiko library. The script retrieves the output of the "net-stats -l" command and prints it to the screen. It then prompts the user to enter the name of the virtual machine they want to packet capture on. It checks if the user's input is a valid virtual machine name by creating a list of valid virtual machine names from the output of the "net-stats -l" command and checking if the user's input is in that list. If the user's input is not a valid virtual machine name, the script exits. If the user's input is a valid virtual machine name, the script prints out the packet capture command for the user to copy and paste and use. The script also includes a section to check if the virtual machine name identified is a physical nic on an ESXi host, a VMkernel interface, or a virtual machine, and prints out the appropriate packet capture command for each case.
